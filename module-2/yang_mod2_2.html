    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro">My name is Alexis Yang. I am 25 years old and my birthday is on July 9. My hobbies include reading, sleeping, and playing games.</p>
    <p>Recently, I have found it harder and harder to get and keep myself motivated to do pretty much anything. Maybe it's the start of the new year in addition to the cold winter, but in my opinion, this is not a good thing. Hopefully, my motivation is not a downward spiral.</p>
    <p>On the topic of my motivation, maybe it has to do with my newfound motto...<span class="sentence">"If you can sit, never stand. If you can lie down, never sit."</span> In all honesty, the moment I found this quote, I have decided to live by it. That was perhaps the biggest mistake I have made in my life so far.</p>
    <p>Going abroad has always been my all-time goal. I would love to visit just every part of the world, from South America to Europe and from Asia to Australia. Unfortunately, traveling is expensive no matter how I think about it. One day, I will become so rich that I can travel and splurge freely without any worries.</p>
